# rotunda-exercise

Hi!

In this repository I pushed the Rotunda Exercises solutions for my interview. I hope that you enjoy the correction!

## Introduction

Each exrecise is within its own folder. So, we have:

1. Zoo exercise done in `./zoo`.
2. Error Alarm exercise done in `./error-alarm`.
3. Url Parser exercise done in `./url-parser`.

## Running Zoo and Url Parser exersices

Both exersices have an example of how they work in the `index.js` file at their root folder. To run them you have to:

1. `npm run start:url-parser` to run Url Parser exercise.
2. `npm run start:zoo {animalType} "I'm an animal"` to run Zoo exercise, where `{animalType}` could by: cow, dog, duck, frog, lion, pig or tiger.

They should show some output by the console.

## Exercise Error Alarm

I've solved this exercise as a tech spec for a possible solution of the problem. You can read it from the README.md file inside `./error-alarm`.
